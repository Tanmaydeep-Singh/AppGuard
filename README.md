# AppGuard

**AppGuard** is a desktop application designed to help users manage their time by tracking the daily usage of installed applications and enforcing custom usage limits. Users can set specific time limits for each app, and AppGuard will automatically block access once the usage exceeds the set limit. 

### Features:
- Track daily average usage time for all installed apps.
- Set custom time limits for individual apps.
- Automatically block or terminate applications once the set time limit is reached.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- User-friendly interface to monitor app usage and manage limits.

### Technologies:
- **Frontend:** Tauri/Electron for the GUI
- **Backend:** Rust/Node.js for system-level process management
- **Database:** SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing usage data and preferences
